# Negativez Library
A UI library Inspired By Splix & BBot & More But I Modified Linoria Library.

Thank You For Library : [Linoria](https://github.com/violin-suzutsuki/LinoriaLib)

###### Example Script: 
* [Example](Example.lua)

###### Interface Addons:
* [Theme Manager](addons/ThemeManager.lua)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Save Manager](addons/SaveManager.lua) 

## Features
- Tabs,Section,Tab Boxes
- Almost Any UI Element You Would Ever Need (Toggle & Sliders & Dropdown & etc)
- Interface Automatically Becomes Scrollable Whenever There Are Too Many UI Elements
- Dependency Boxes, Allowing You To Easily Hide/Show UI Elements Depending On The State Of Other UI Elements (I Will Update)
